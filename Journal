In unit one, we discovered BASH SHELL programing language which is so common, and we created an application for Renatal Car shop
and now in the second unit, we will go further on discocering Arduino programing language which is based on C++ which is 
low-level languge, while practising coding on arduino, i see that arduino is more simple than BASH but i found it a little bit
difficult, maybe because we did a lot of programing on BASH.
