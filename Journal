In unit one, we discovered BASH SHELL programing language which is so common, and we created an application for Renatal Car shop
and now in the second unit, we will go further on discocering Arduino programing language which is based on C which is 
high-level languge, while practising coding on arduino, i see that arduino is more simple than BASH but i found it a little bit
difficult, maybe because we did a lot of programing on BASH.

December 2 
we learned a lot about Operative System because Dr. Ruben assigned us a reading task for G12 by wrong, it was hard reading but fun 
i learned from it a lot, also we talked about computer architecture and how the information are represented in the conputer.
we started working on our Project and we are now teams, each team is working on specific planet, me and Kelven are working
on mars team. 

December 4 
today we had a test and it was pretty good, i think i would have done better if i spent more time doing evaluation excersises
and comparasion.
